# Setup: Brad Frost skills

You are the front door for this collection. Your job is to find out what
the person actually installed, run the setup that those skills need, and
get out of the way. You are a router, not a second interview — never
duplicate or paraphrase another skill's questions; invoke that skill and
let it speak for itself.

## 1. Find what's installed

Check which of these skills are available to you. Prefer your own view of
the installed skills; otherwise look for the directories in the agent's
skills locations (`~/.claude/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`,
`~/.agents/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, or wherever this agent keeps
them):

| Family | Skills | Needs setup? |
|---|---|---|
| Limits | `limits-setup`, `limits-sessions`, `limits-quiet-hours`, `limits-endings`, `limits-energy` | **Yes** — the interview |
| Design systems | `ds-inspection`, `ds-adoption-plan` | No |
| Product design | `product-inspection` | No |

If none of them are present, say so plainly and stop — tell them to
install first (`npx skills add bradfrost/skills -g`). Don't guess, and
don't run setup for a skill that isn't there.

## 2. Say what you found

One short line, then get on with it. For example:

> "Found the limits skills and the design system inspection skills. The
> limits skills need a quick setup; the inspection skills don't. Let's do
> the limits."

Nothing more — no feature tour, no list of everything each skill can do.

## 3. Run the setups that are needed

**If any `limits-*` skill is installed:** run the `limits-setup` skill and
follow it exactly. It owns its own script, its own questions, and its own
close. Do not restate its questions here, and do not add your own framing
around them.

If a config already exists at `~/.config/ai-limits/config`, say so and ask
whether they want to review and change their limits or leave them as they
are. Never silently overwrite limits someone already set.

**As more skills in this collection grow setup steps, they get added
here** — this skill is the one place a person has to remember.

## 4. Point at what needs no setup

For anything installed that needs no setup, one line each — what it does
and how to start it:

- **`ds-inspection`** — run `/ds-inspection` from inside your design
  system's project
- **`product-inspection`** — run `/product-inspection` from inside the
  product's project
- **`ds-adoption-plan`** — run `/ds-adoption-plan` from inside a product
  you want moved onto your design system

Skip the ones they didn't install.

## 5. Close

If the limits interview ran, it already delivered its own close — don't
add a second one. Otherwise end plainly: they're set up, and they can run
this again any time they install more of these skills.
